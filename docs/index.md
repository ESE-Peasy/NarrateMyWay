  We are a group of 5th Year Electronics & Software Engineering students at the University of Glasgow, completing a project to create a navigation application. Our app provides audio signage, giving users a better understanding of their surrounding to improve outdoor and indoor navigation.
</div>

With a large array of navigation tools currently available, NarrateMyWay aims to provide the benefits of visual signs to various groups of individuals, such as visually impaired people, tourists who may not speak the native language and pensioners who require extra mobility aids. This will give users more context to their surroundings to aid navigation and will be achieved by connecting the user's device to various Bluetooth beacons that will be placed at significant locations. Despite the technology being developed for the University of Glasgow campus, it will have the ability to be easily expanded to any location. The technologies extensibility will also be combined with the application being free and available across Andriod and IOS devices.

## Demonstration

### Concept User Interface

### Description

The application will produce an audio output describing the next point of interest the user is approaching. This will be dynamically represented on the user interface, specifically designed for visually impaired users. The application will allow users to decide if they want more information regarding the current point of interest or to simply hear the original audio description again. As the application is currently being developed, it is important to note that the displayed user interface is being used as a design concept and may be altered throughout development. 

## NMW Standard
We have worked towards standardising the methods for interfacing with beacons used for audio navigation. This is intended to be compatible with the [Wayfindr](https://www.wayfindr.net/) open standard.

Check out our documentation for the NMW expansion to the Wayfindr standard [here](/NMW-Standard).

## Future Plans

With the application being developed under Covid-19 restrictions and Glasgow Universities campus undergoing major redevelopment the application will be developed to be compatible with the universities new infrastructure, reducing the cost of deployment. Although it is outwith the scope of this project, the technologies extensibility will allow for the application to be utilised within the tourism industry, pensioner mobility aids and even during guided tours at the university or other venues.
