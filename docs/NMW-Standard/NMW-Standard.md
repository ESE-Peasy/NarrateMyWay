# NMW Standard
We have worked towards standardising the methods for interfacing with beacons used for audio navigation. This is intended to be compatible with the [Wayfindr](https://www.wayfindr.net/) open standard.

Our standard makes reference to location-specific information that is linked to Bluetooth UUIDs. We describe implementation/interface details in  the [Location Specific Information](Location-Specific-Information.md) page.
